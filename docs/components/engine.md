# Engine

Where it all begins. The engine setups up the [game loop](../guides/game-loop), along with the following:

- Keyboard event handling.
- Pointer (mouse and touch) event handling.
- Device motion event handling.
- Device orientation event handling.

It sits at the root of your game's component hierarchy.
