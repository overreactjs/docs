# Introduction

_Overreact_ is a browser-based game engine, built on top of React, which renders to the DOM, is is styled with plain old CSS!

‚öõÔ∏è‚ÄÇBuilt on top of React, allowing you to utilize the same patterns and architecture you're familiar with.

‚ö°Ô∏è‚ÄÇShare components with the rest of your app. Use your design system components in your game!

üíÖ‚ÄÇStyle your game elements using regular CSS. Or bring in your favorite CSS frameworks, such as tailwind.

## Why build a new game engine?

Sure, there are a number of well-written, well-tested, well-documented, and well-supported browser-based game engines out there already. There are even some that are built on top of React, and not all of them render to a canvas, although nearly all do.

But, like many interesting projects, this started out as an experiment. Other game engines require a paradigm shift away from what frontend developers are familiar with. To some extend that will always be necessary, but I wanted to see if it was feasible to build a game engine that leans into React's component-based philosophy, that renders to the DOM and can be styled using CSS or tools such as tailwind.

_Overreact_ is the outcome of that experiment!
