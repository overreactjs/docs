# Getting Started

Added _Overreact_ to your project is as simple as:

```bash
npm install @overreact/engine
```

One day there'll be an in-depth tutorial here, to introduce you to _Overreact_ in a nice, structured way. But until then, you can find a collection of example games at https://github.com/overreactjs/examples
